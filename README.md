 <li>There is one assignment: To create a relational implementation of an ER diagram.</li>

 <li>2 Assignments</li>

 <li>You will need to create a relational implementation modifying relational05.architect, of the ER diagram 56 Assignment05.drawio satisfying the annotations in Assignment05.txt, using SQL Power Architect with</li>

</ul>

57 Crow’s feet notation and including the needed (but only the needed) annotations. Replace zk1 with your Net 58 ID and note what’s specified in Item 1a. You should follow <em>exactly </em>the ER diagram given and the example 59 of the University database we covered in class. Do not create better relational implementations if such are 60 possible by deviating from the ER diagram.

<ul>

 <li>(a) Specify the following using SQL Power Architect and everything else that needs to be specified (if</li>

 <li>anything) put in annotations by modifying Solution05.txt</li>

 <li>tables</li>

 <li>attributes, including for each that</li>

 <li>– it must not be NULL (if applicable)</li>

 <li>– it is a part of the primary key (if applicable)</li>

 <li>– it is a part of a foreign key (if applicable)</li>

 <li>It is not important for us what the domains of the attributes are, so use VARCHAR as the domain</li>

 <li>for all attributes</li>

 <li>many-to-one mappings between tables (or one-to-one as applicable)</li>

 <li>Please,</li>

 <li>Do <em>not </em>make any assumptions about the application beyond the specifications listed. 73 • Do not optimize your design, just follow the specification given.</li>

</ul>

74 • Do not use any other capabilities that SQL Power Architect provides; for example do not use 75 Index Properties or Remarks for Column Properties.

76                    • Anything that cannot be specified in your SQL Power Architect diagram, put as annotations in 77 Solution05.txt file, as described below.

78                    • Do <em>not </em>put anything in the annotations that can be reflected in the SQL Power Architect imple79  mentation; make sure that the implementation reflects that.

80                                        (b) Modify the file Solution05.txt as specified in Item 1 of Section 3.
